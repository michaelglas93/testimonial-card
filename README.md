# GreatFrontEnd Projects Challenge "Testimonial Card"

## Getting started

### Overview

At a high level, completing each challenge involves the following steps:

1. Start the challenge from the challenge page.
2. Understand the challenge's functional and visual requirements.
3. Download starter code (optional), reference designs. For the best experience, obtain access to the Figma files.
4. Set up your coding environment and GitHub repository.
5. Develop using your preferred technology stack while referencing the designs, style guides, and any provided guides.
6. Ask for help if necessary.
7. Upon completion, review your work.
8. Deploy your work on available hosting platforms.
9. Submit your work and share it with the world!


### Provided assets

For each challenge, we provide the following assets:

- **Starter/skeleton code**: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `index.js`.
- **Designs**: The `designs` directory contains reference image design files for the various device breakpoints and states for the challenge. With only these images, it can be hard to determine the exact styling required, so `style-guide.md` contains valuable information about the design, such as device breakpoints, typography styles, and color palette.
- **Images**: If the challenge uses some images such as illustrations, logos, etc, they will be provided in the `img` directory.
- **Icons**: Icons can be found on [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/).

For the best (and realistic) experience, we recommend developing while referencing the challenge's Figma file. If the challenge is free or you have a [GreatFrontEnd Projects Premium](https://greatfrontend.com/projects/pricing) subscription, you'd be able to download the challenge's `.fig` Figma file, which will allow you to emulate developers at work – inspecting high fidelity designs and diving into each element's properties like colors, font sizes, spacing, etc.

### Using Figma files

The downloaded `.fig` file can be opened using the [Figma website](https://www.figma.com/) or [desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads/). By inspecting the Figma file, you will be able to build as closely as possible to the design.

If you are new to Figma, here are some useful resources to help you get acquainted with Figma:

- [Intro to Figma for Developers by Scrimba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ-OU_7aBv4)
- [Figma Onboarding Kit for Developers](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1202517341060356377)
- [Figma 101 for Developers](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1199577674592933191)

As a developer, you do not have to learn how to create designs with Figma; you primarily have to know how to navigate a file, selecting frames, inspect properties of the elements such as their size, color, spacing, typography, etc.

## Working on the challenge

### Developing the challenge

Out-of-the-box, our starter templates help you get started with the challenges using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The easiest way to start developing is to open the `index.html` file using an IDE (Integrated Development Editor) like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and start changing the code. To preview the result, open `index.html` using a web browser. Remember to refresh the browser to see any updates!

That said, you are free to choose a technology stack as you deem fit – React, Next.js, Vite, Vue, you name it. Where relevant and possible, you can integrate these libraries into the starter template.

You can even use the recommended starter code provided by your chosen tech stack but you will be in-charge of adding necessary code for CSS resets, copying any provided image assets over and importing the challenge font. There aren't a lot of them, so you can poke around the starter code files and easily identify what to copy into your custom setup.

Here's a basic outline of the process of converting a design image into front end code:

1. **Study the design**: Examine the design images / Figma files with the aim of understanding the layout, components, typography, colors, interactions and any responsive design requirements for different screen sizes. Be sure to also cross check with the provided style guide.
2. **HTML structure**: Plan the HTML structure of the challenge based on the design. Use semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.
3. **CSS styling**: Apply CSS styling to the HTML elements to match the visual design. Use CSS classes to set font styles, sizes, colors, margins, paddings, borders, and backgrounds while referring to the design, style guide, and Figma file.
4. **Responsive design**: Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks and functions well on different devices and screen sizes. Use media queries to adjust layout, font sizes, and other styling properties as needed for various breakpoints.
5. **Interactivity and JavaScript**: Implement any interactive features or animations using JavaScript or front end frameworks like React or Vue.js.


### Deploy your site

Deployment is the process of putting your website's code onto publicly-accessible web servers so that anyone in the world can visit your website.

We recommend the following hosting providers where you can deploy your website for free:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): If you are using the default starter code template hosted on a public GitHub repository, this is the easiest and fastest way to get your site deployed.
- [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/): Vercel offers a one-click deployment experience just by connecting your GitHub repository and they have a generous free tier. Could be overkill for hosting static files that don't require a build step.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): Similar offerings as Vercel.
